I tried re-re-re-re-relearning HTML and CSS in one day so the code might be *bad*.
This is a personal website just to tell people about myself and put silly stuff in.
Feel free to look through the source code, it might help you understand how stuff works.
Please note that its still something made by a beginner.

Website is tested using [Helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium), which uses [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium), so if you're using any chromium browser it *should* look good enough. I can't guarantee the same for Firefox.

I tried making it look decent on mobile, hopefully there's not much of an issue.
